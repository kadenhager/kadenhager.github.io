    "text": "Ever since the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl in 2016, it’s been an absolute disaster at the quarterback position since the retirement of Peyton Manning.\nLast winter, the Broncos went all in on getting a franchise-level quarterback, acquiring eight-time pro-bowler Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks. Denver gave up three players four draft picks across the 2022 and 2023 season.\nWell, Wilson’s first season in Denver didn’t go as planned. Posting a 5-12 record and raising a lot of skepticism on the quarterback’s productivity. It raised a lot of questions if he could produce at the all-pro level that he had been performing at throughout his career.\nHere is a deeper dive into some of his statistics since his 2013 Super Bowl season to see if Wilson is actually washed or not.\nFirst, a look at his completion percentage and QBR over the last nine seasons.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nNFL22 <- \"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/passing.htm\"\n\nNFL13 <-

the NFL, coaches and analysts like to see quarterbacks at or above the 60 percent range. Wilson’s completion percentage has never dipped below 60 percent, even in his first year at Denver where it was considered one his worst seasons. His first year in Denver was his lowest in his career, but still productive for an NFL quarterback.\nBut, his QBR is a different story. Wilson posted a career low in QBR last season with a 36.7 QBR rating. The last three seasons, his QBR has dropped by at least 13. His QBR rating last season barely cracked the top 50 in the league.\nAnother big part of a quarterback’s game is their touchdown to interception ratio.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=Project2, \n    aes(y=Age, x=TD, xend=Int),\nsize = 1,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n  labs(\nx=\"Touchdown-to-Interception Ratio\", \ny=\"\", \ntitle=\"Russell Wilson took a couple steps down in first year in Denver\", \nsubtitle=\"Wilson's last two season in Seattle were some his most productive.\", \ncaption=\"Source: pro-football-reference.com | By Kaden Hager\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWell right away, you notice that Wilson’s posted another low with 16 passing touchdowns in 2022. But, if you take a look, in one of his Super Bowl seasons, Wilson passed for only 20 touchdowns, which at the time was considered his “prime”.\nBut, just two years ago, Wilson had a 40 passing touchdown season. He has also never posted a season where he threw more than 13 interceptions in one season.\nOne more stat that is crucial in football, especially at the quarterback position, is passing yards.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Project1, aes(x=Age, y=Yds, group=Player), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=Project2, aes(x=Age, y=Yds, group=1), color=\"#FB4F14\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1500, 5000)) + \n  labs(\nx=\"Passing yards by each season\", \ny=\"\", \ntitle=\"Russell Wilson's passing yards where up his first year in Denver\", \nsubtitle=\"Wilson had a big drop off between his last two years in Seattle.\", \ncaption=\"Source: pro-football-reference.com | By Kaden Hager\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at this graph, the first thing that jumps out at his two Super Bowl appearance seasons were average seasons for him in the passing yards department. His passing yards were his highest in last years in Seattle. But, his final season with the Seahawks he had a big drop off due to injury.\nIn conclusion, after looking at his stats over the last nine years, Wilson has dropped off in some categories, but still has the tools to be a productive quarterback in the National Football League."

Every year, college football’s end goal is to make the college football playoffs and if they don’t do that, get an invite to a New Year’s Six Bowl.\nOf the six bowl games, you can argue that the Rose Bowl is one of the most iconic bowl games of the year or in Keith William’s words, “The Granddaddy of Them All”. Every year, the Pac-12 conference champion and the Big Ten conference champion meet in Pasadena, California for the iconic game.\nThe game itself has produced some memorable games, some overtime thrillers to some absolute beat-downs of a contest. Over the course of the last 17 seasons, I want to dig down deep on the teams that lost the bowl game, which team offensively was the least deserving of being there?\nFirst, I wanted to look at the

Wisconsin surprisingly had the second most touchdown passes with 34 and was also near the bottom of interceptions with only five interceptions.\nIllinois came up at the bottom of passing touchdowns with only two all year, which was good for dead last in the 2007-08 season among all FBS schools. The Fighting Illini were also near the top of the teams with 15 interceptions on the year.\nFlorida State, who was a part of the first College Football Playoff, led all of the teams in interceptions 20. The 20 interceptions was good for fifth most in the country in the 2014-15 season. Their quarterback that season Jamesis Winston, was coming off a Heisman Trophy season his freshman year.\nWhen also having a productive offense in college football, the great teams are also well balanced on offense. Now let’s look at the team’s passing yards per game and rushing yards per game.\n\n\nCode\nbar3 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Oklahoma2017, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#841617\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2012, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FloridaState2014, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#782F40\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Passing Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"Two College Football Playoff teams were on the top of passing yards\", \n    subtitle=\"Illinois and Florida State proved that they are both one dimensional football teams\", \n    caption=\"\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  )\n\nbar4 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FloridaState2014, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#782F40\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2010, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2011, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2012, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2019, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Oklahoma2017, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#841617\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Rushing Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"\", \n    subtitle=\"\", \n    caption=\"Source: collegefootballdata.com | By: Kaden Hager\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar3, bar4)\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma and Florida State, Two College Football Playoff teams, rank at the top in the passing yards per game department. But, Florida State ranked at the bottom of all teams in rushing yards per game. Oklahoma, however, was about in the middle of the pack.\nIllinois and Wisconsin ranked at the bottom of the passing yards per game. But Illinois led all teams in rushing yards per game with 256, which was good for sixth in the nation in 2007. Also, all four of the Wisconsin teams that participated in the Rose held four of the top five spots in rushing yards per game.\nFinally, for the last graph. I wanted to see what teams found the end zone the most on the ground.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2010, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2011, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2012, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2019, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n   geom_bar(data=Michigan2006, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#00274C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Rushing Touchdowns\", \n    title=\"Wisconsin has four of the top five spots for rushing touchdowns\", \n    subtitle=\"Illinois led all teams in rushing yards per game, but was dead last in rushing touchdowns\", \n    caption=\"Source: collegefootballdata.com | By: Kaden Hager\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four Wisconsin teams held the top spots for rushing touchdowns. In 2010 and 2011, the Badgers found the end zone on the ground 48 times, which is near the top each year in the country.\nIllinois was tied with Michigan for last in rushing touchdowns with 21 after leading all teams in rushing yards per game.\nSo, in conclusion, Illinois and Florida State both very one dimensional on offense. Both teams got blown out on the biggest stage. Oklahoma on the other hand, lost in overtime to Georgia in the College Football Playoff, while producing one of the most productive seasons on offense we have ever seen in college football."
