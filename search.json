    "text": "A college football team works all season long to accomplish one thing, qualify for the postseason. Every year, college football’s end goal is to make the college football playoffs and if they don’t do that, get an invite to a New Year’s Six Bowl.\nOf the six bowl games, you can argue that the Rose Bowl is one of the most iconic bowl games of the year or in Keith William’s words, “The Granddaddy of Them All”. Every year, the Pac-12 conference champion and the Big Ten conference champion meet in Pasadena, California for the iconic game.\nThe game itself has produced some memorable games, some overtime thrillers to some absolute beat-downs of a contest. Over the course of the last 17 seasons, I want to dig down deep on the teams that lost the bowl game, which team offensively was the least deserving of being there?\nFirst, I wanted to look at the yards per game between the teams that lost the Rose Bowl.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nteamstats22 <- cfbd_stats_season_team(\n  2022,\n

The next closest was Wisconsin in 2011, averaging 469 yards per game.\nThe bottom three teams averaged under 400 yards of total offense. All three of the teams were also Big Ten teams. Michigan in the 2007 Rose Bowl lost to USC by 14 points and Iowa lost to Stanford by 29 points.\nAnother thing that is huge for a productive offense is your touchdown-to-interception ratio. The general rule of thumb is two touchdowns to one interception ratio.\n\n\nCode\nbar1 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, pass_TDs), weight=pass_TDs), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_classic() +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, pass_TDs), weight=pass_TDs), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Oklahoma2017, aes(x=reorder(team_season, pass_TDs), weight=pass_TDs), fill=\"#841617\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FloridaState2014, aes(x=reorder(team_season, pass_TDs), weight=pass_TDs), fill=\"#782F40\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2011, aes(x=reorder(team_season, pass_TDs), weight=pass_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Passing Touchdowns\", \n    title=\"Illinois had the worst touchdown to interception ratio of any team\",\n    subtitle=\"The Fighting Illini's two passing touchdowns was good for dead last in the country in 2007\", \n    caption=\"\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, interceptions), weight=interceptions), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, interceptions), weight=interceptions), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FloridaState2014, aes(x=reorder(team_season, interceptions), weight=interceptions), fill=\"#782F40\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Oklahoma2017, aes(x=reorder(team_season, interceptions), weight=interceptions), fill=\"#841617\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2011, aes(x=reorder(team_season, interceptions), weight=interceptions), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Interceptions\", \n    title=\"\", \n    subtitle=\"\", \n    caption=\"Source: collegefootballdata.com | By: Kaden Hager\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar1,bar2)\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Oklahoma had the most touchdown passes with 47 and was near the bottom of interceptions with only eight all year. Wisconsin surprisingly had the second most touchdown passes with 34 and was also near the bottom of interceptions with only five interceptions.\nIllinois came up at the bottom of passing touchdowns with only two all year, which was good for dead last in the 2007-08 season among all FBS schools. The Fighting Illini were also near the top of the teams with 15 interceptions on the year.\nFlorida State, who was a part of the first College Football Playoff, led all of the teams in interceptions 20. The 20 interceptions was good for fifth most in the country in the 2014-15 season. Their quarterback that season Jamesis Winston, was coming off a Heisman Trophy season his freshman year.\nWhen also having a productive offense in college football, the great teams are also well balanced on offense. Now let’s look at the team’s passing yards per game and rushing yards per game.\n\n\nCode\nbar3 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Oklahoma2017, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#841617\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2012, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FloridaState2014, aes(x=reorder(team_season, PYPG), weight=PYPG), fill=\"#782F40\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Passing Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"Two College Football Playoff teams were on the top of passing yards\", \n    subtitle=\"Illinois and Florida State proved that they are both one dimensional football teams\", \n    caption=\"\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  )\n\nbar4 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FloridaState2014, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#782F40\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2010, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2011, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2012, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2019, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Oklahoma2017, aes(x=reorder(team_season, RPG), weight=RPG), fill=\"#841617\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Rushing Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"\", \n    subtitle=\"\", \n    caption=\"Source: collegefootballdata.com | By: Kaden Hager\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar3, bar4)\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma and Florida State, Two College Football Playoff teams, rank at the top in the passing yards per game department. But, Florida State ranked at the bottom of all teams in rushing yards per game. Oklahoma, however, was about in the middle of the pack.\nIllinois and Wisconsin ranked at the bottom of the passing yards per game. But Illinois led all teams in rushing yards per game with 256, which was good for sixth in the nation in 2007. Also, all four of the Wisconsin teams that participated in the Rose held four of the top five spots in rushing yards per game.\nFinally, for the last graph. I wanted to see what teams found the end zone the most on the ground.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=selectedteams, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2010, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2011, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2012, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wisconsin2019, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#C5050C\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Illinois2007, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#E84A27\") +\n   geom_bar(data=Michigan2006, aes(x=reorder(team_season, rush_TDs), weight=rush_TDs), fill=\"#00274C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Rushing Touchdowns\", \n    title=\"Wisconsin has four of the top five spots for rushing touchdowns\", \n    subtitle=\"Illinois led all teams in rushing yards per game, but was dead last in rushing touchdowns\", \n    caption=\"Source: collegefootballdata.com | By: Kaden Hager\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four Wisconsin teams held the top spots for rushing touchdowns. In 2010 and 2011, the Badgers found the end zone on the ground 48 times, which is near the top each year in the country.\nIllinois was tied with Michigan for last in rushing touchdowns with 21 after leading all teams in rushing yards per game.\nSo, in conclusion, Illinois and Florida State both very one dimensional on offense. Both teams got blown out on the biggest stage. Oklahoma on the other hand, lost in overtime to Georgia in the College Football Playoff, while producing one of the most productive seasons on offense we have ever seen in college football."
